> interior desgin tool has been removed from the deployed version for now due to some bugs and basically because of it being incomplete, i am working on it atm.


A wannabe CAD type tool in which you can build a habitat from basic prebuilt modules or import your custom modules, make a habitat and then export it in various 3d formats as well. It allows for exterior and interior habitat layout design. It also saves everything currently in localstorage, i will add a backend later though.

##  Import / Export Workflow
import export supported in stl, glb and json. 

## Tech Stack
just take a look at the package jdon for this


## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev

# Build production bundle
npm run build

# Preview production build

```
