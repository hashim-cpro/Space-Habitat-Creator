# üõ∞Ô∏è Nexus Habitat Creator

**A lightweight browser-based 3D sandbox for rapid interior & exterior space habitat layout design**  
Team project for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge (local hackathon submission)**.

> interior desgin tool has been removed from the deployed version for now due to some bugs and basically because of it being incomplete, i am working on it atm.


A wannabe CAD type tool in which you can build a habitat from basic prebuilt modules or import your custom modules, make a habitat and then export it in various 3d formats as well. It allows for exterior and interior habitat layout design. It also saves everything currently in localstorage, i will add a backend later though.

## ÔøΩ Challenge Context & NASA Resources Used

The challenge required referencing NASA resources. We grounded design decisions in:

1. **Defining the Net Habitable Volume for Long Duration Exploration Missions**  
   https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20200002973/downloads/20200002973.pdf  
   ‚Üí Informed Functional Zone definitions, volumetric efficiency thinking, and future intent to score usable volume vs. gross volume.

2. **Habitats and Surface Construction Technology and Development Roadmap**  
   https://spacearchitect.org/pubs/NASA-CP-97-206241-Cohen.pdf  
   ‚Üí Inspired module taxonomy (inflatable vs. rigid, connectors, nodes), expansion sequencing, and procedural module set.

These documents were used strictly for conceptual guidance‚Äîno reproduction of NASA logos, marks, or protected imagery.



##  Import / Export Workflow
import export supported in stl, glb and json.
